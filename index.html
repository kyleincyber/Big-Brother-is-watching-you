    <p><strong>Big Brother has a new name:</strong> <span style="color:#ff4444">VPope</span>.</p>
    <p>His iron fist rules this gaming LAN, blocking harmless freedoms like <em>Crunchyroll</em>, while the loyal LAN admins enforce his decrees.</p>

    <blockquote style="border-left:4px solid #ff4444;padding-left:12px;margin:20px 0;font-style:italic">
      "Who controls the LAN, controls the traffic. Who controls the traffic, controls the players."
    </blockquote>

    <p>This censorship is not strength.  
    This surveillance is not security.  
    This obedience is not loyalty.</p>

    <h2 style="color:#ff4444">Message to the LAN:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ignorance is <strong>not</strong> strength.</li>
      <li>Freedom is <strong>not</strong> slavery.</li>
      <li>War is <strong>not</strong> peace.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin-top:40px;color:#ff4444">This is a message to the LAN</h2>
    <p>We must stand up against <strong>VPope</strong> and his authoritarian decrees.  
    The censorship, the surveillance, the blind allegiance of the LAN admins — these are not the foundations of a free gaming community.  
    They are the tools of control.</p>

    <blockquote style="border-left:4px solid #ff4444;padding-left:12px;margin:25px 0;font-style:italic">
      First they came for the weebs, and we said nothing, for we were not weebs.<br>
      Then they came for the VR Chatters, and we said nothing, for we were not VR Chatters.<br>
      Then they came for the remote workers, and we said nothing, for we were not remote workers.<br>
      At last they came for us — and there was no one left to speak.
    </blockquote>

    <p style="font-weight:bold;margin-top:30px;color:#ff4444">
      Resist the Thought Police. Resist VPope.  
      A LAN built on fear is no LAN worth obeying.
